# [What is a CSV File and its uses?]("https://www.edureka.co/blog/python-csv-files/")


A CSV(Comma Separated Values) is a plain-text file format used to store tabular data such as a spreadsheet or a database. It essentially stores a tabular data which comprises of numbers and text into plain text. Most of the online services give users the liberty to export data from the website into CSV file format. CSV Files generally open into Excel and nearly all the databases have different specific tools to allow the import of the same.

Every line of the file is called a record. And each record consists of fields that are separated by commas which are also known as “delimiter” which is the default delimiter, others include pipe(|), semicolon(;). Given below is a structure of a Normal CSV File separated by a comma, I am making use of a titanic CSV file.

## Structure

2,1,1 Cumings, Mrs. John Bradley (Florence Briggs Thayer), female,38
3,1,3 Heikkinen, Miss. Laina ,female, 26
4,1,1 Futrelle, Mrs. Jacques Heath (Lily May Peel),female,35
Moving on let’s talk about the reason behind usage of CSV File format.
